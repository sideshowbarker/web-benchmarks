# Ladybird Web Benchmarks

This repository contains a set of web benchmarks used to measure the performance of the Ladybird browser engine.

# Installation

To install the python packages required by the benchmark runner you must install the packages listed in 
`requirements.txt`. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Benchmarks

Before running the benchmarks you must first build Ladybird using the [build instructions for Ladybird](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/Documentation/BuildInstructionsLadybird.md). 
For best results, it is recommended to build Ladybird with the `Distribution` build preset, like so: 

```bash
BUILD_PRESET=Distribution ./Meta/ladybird.py build ladybird
```

After Ladybird is built, benchmarks are run using the `run.py` script. You must provide the path to the Ladybird 
executable using the `--executable` argument. For example:

```bash
./run.py --executable "${LADYBIRD_SOURCE_DIR}/Build/distribution/bin/ladybird" --output results.json  
```

Use `--benchmarks` to select one or more benchmarks. The imported WebKit
performance suites are available as `WebKitBindings`, `WebKitCSS`, `WebKitDOM`,
`WebKitParser`, and `WebKitSVG`:

```bash
./run.py --executable "${LADYBIRD_SOURCE_DIR}/Build/distribution/bin/ladybird" \
    --benchmarks WebKitDOM,WebKitCSS --output results.json
```

These suites were imported from WebKit revision
`2e5d042491f325b2df778dbba97c48d66bf2d395`. They run one sample per test by
default; pass `--iterations` to choose another sample count. Runs-per-second
tests use fixed batch sizes and report the elapsed time for that workload, so
faster code also shortens the benchmark run. Each suite's `Skipped` file records
tests excluded by WebKit or by this runner.

`MicroWeb` is a home-grown suite of ~230 fine-grained time-based microbenchmarks
covering the primitives Speedometer3 exercises (DOM API, render pipeline, layout
modes, style invalidation, text shaping, JS, canvas, SVG, parsing, shadow DOM,
events, editing, observers, timers, URL/history, storage). See
`benchmarks/MicroWeb/README.md` for the comparison workflow against Chromium.

To run any benchmark under Chromium for comparison, pass `--browser chromium`
(and typically `--jitless`, which disables the V8 JIT for an engine-vs-engine
comparison):

```bash
./run.py --executable /snap/bin/chromium --browser chromium --jitless \
    --benchmarks MicroWeb -o chromium.json
```

`ratios.py` then ranks every test by the subject/reference time multiplier,
worst first:

```bash
./ratios.py --subject ladybird.json --reference chromium.json
```

## Comparing Results

After running benchmarks and saving the results as a JSON file, you can compare the results using the `compare.py` 
script. For example:

```bash
./compare.py -o old.json -n new.json
```

## Measuring a Branch Before a PR

`bench_pr.py` compares a Ladybird branch against its merge-base: It compiles both, runs every suite in an interleaved loop, tests the per-test differences for significance, and writes the performance section for the PR body.

```bash
cd /path/to/your-ladybird-branch
/path/to/web-benchmarks/bench_pr.py
```

Calibrate the machine against itself once first (`--calibrate`) — so the run knows what it can resolve. `MEASURING-A-BRANCH.md` covers how to read the output, and explains what a run can and can’t detect.
